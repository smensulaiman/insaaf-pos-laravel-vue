If you're still running into issues, I recommend using nvm (Node Version Manager), which will allow you to easily manage multiple versions of Node.js without conflicts.

To install nvm:

curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc


After that, you can install Node.js 14 via nvm:

nvm install 14
nvm use 14


Now, when you check your version:

node -v


It should show v14.x.x.
